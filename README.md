# Hotel Booking App

A Django 6.0 hotel booking platform with role-based access (customers / hotel owners).

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13.5** / **Django 6.0.6** / **SQLite**
- **Pillow** — image uploads
- Console email backend (password reset prints to terminal)

## Features

- **Auth**: email-based login, signup, password change/reset, roles (`customer` / `owner`)
- **Profile**: auto-created via signal, update at `/accounts/profile/update/`
- **Hotels**: browse/search/filter, owner-only CRUD, paginated grid (9/page)
- **Rooms**: browse/search/filter by type, owner-only CRUD, paginated grid (12/page), linked from hotel detail
- **Bookings**: user-scoped CRUD, auto-computed `total_price = price_per_night * nights`, status badges, paginated (10/page)
- **Payments**: one payment per booking, auto-set amount, method selection (card/PayPal/bank/cash), linked from booking detail
